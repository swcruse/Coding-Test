# Coding-Test
applying to NW coding Boot Camp

I am Sharon Walton-Cruse.  I am currently trying to complete this test to get accepted into Northwesterns Coding Boot Camp.  I am a displaced homemaker, i.e. going through a divorce after 30 years of not working outside of the home.

I'm hoping to get into the program to start over and live on my own and for myself, but hoping to impact the world to make it a better place.
